# NAME

Hack::Natas - solve some of the Natas server-side security war games

# VERSION

version 0.002

# DESCRIPTION

[overthewire.org](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/) has a series of war games.
Natas is the server-side security challenge.

This package contains some scripts to automate solving some of the tedious levels,
and documents walking you through all levels up to \#17.

This role provides the basic attributes and methods which are generally
required for scripting password extraction.

# METHODS

## get

This sets the query string of the `uri` according to the key-value pairs
passed in. Then, does an HTTP GET for that resource, and returns the
response (a hashref).

## run

The implementation of `run` must be provided by the consuming class.

Before `run` executes, turn on autoflush for STDOUT.

After __run__ executes, print out the final password.

# ATTRIBUTES

- level - a read-only integer for the current level
- http\_user - the username to use to access the current level. By default, "natas${level}"
- http\_pass - the password to use to access the current level. Required.
- uri - the [URI](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?URI) for the current level. Can be coerced from a string. By default,
this is constructed from the level, http\_user, and http\_pass.
- ua - an [HTTP::Tiny](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTTP::Tiny) object. By default, the timeout is 5s, and the `Host` header is set.
- password - the password we are extracting to access the next level.
- password\_length - the length of the password. This is built by the `get_password_length` method.
