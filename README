NAME
    Hack::Natas - solve some of the Natas server-side security war games

VERSION
    version 0.003

DESCRIPTION
    overthewire.org <http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/> has a series of
    war games. Natas is the server-side security challenge.

    This package contains some scripts to automate solving some of the
    tedious levels, and documents walking you through all levels up to #17.

    This role provides the basic attributes and methods which are generally
    required for scripting password extraction.

METHODS
  get
    This sets the query string of the "uri" according to the key-value pairs
    passed in. Then, does an HTTP GET for that resource, and returns the
    response (a hashref).

  run
    The implementation of "run" must be provided by the consuming class.

    Before "run" executes, turn on autoflush for STDOUT.

    After run executes, print out the final password.

ATTRIBUTES
    *   level - a read-only integer for the current level

    *   http_user - the username to use to access the current level. By
        default, "natas${level}"

    *   http_pass - the password to use to access the current level.
        Required.

    *   uri - the URI for the current level. Can be coerced from a string.
        By default, this is constructed from the level, http_user, and
        http_pass.

    *   ua - an HTTP::Tiny object. By default, the timeout is 5s, and the
        "Host" header is set.

    *   password - the password we are extracting to access the next level.

    *   password_length - the length of the password. This is built by the
        "get_password_length" method.

SEE ALSO
    *   natas15

        Level 15 requires you to do blind SQL injection.

    *   natas16

        Level 16 requires you to do blind shell injection.
